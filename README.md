A Clone of The Odin Project Homepage
This project is my attempt at recreating the homepage for The Odin Project. I built it from the ground up as a way to practice my web development skills.
The main goal was to build a clean and responsive website using the core technologies of the web. I focused on making the layout as accurate as possible and ensuring the structure of the code was solid.
About This Project
I tried to make this clone look and feel like the original site. It's built to be responsive, so it should adjust to fit your screen whether you're on a desktop or a mobile device.
I also added a couple of interactive features to make it more functional. There's a dark mode toggle button that switches the color scheme, and it will remember your choice if you visit the site again. For smaller screens, I included a hamburger menu for the navigation links. The links in the navigation bar also scroll smoothly to the different sections of the page.

What I Used to Build It
I stuck to the fundamentals for this project.
HTML was used to create the structure and content of the page.
CSS was used for all of the styling. This included creating the layout with Flexbox, setting up the color variables for the light and dark themes, and handling the responsive design.
JavaScript was used to power the interactive elements. I wrote plain JavaScript to handle the logic for the dark mode toggle and the mobile menu without using any external libraries.
What I Learned
Building this project was a really valuable experience. It taught me a lot about how to approach a larger layout and how to make all the pieces fit together. I got a much better handle on responsive design and the importance of paying attention to the small details. It was challenging, but I'm proud of the result and what I learned along the way.
Thanks for taking a look at my work.
